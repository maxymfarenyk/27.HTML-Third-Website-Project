        <p>Layne Thomas Staley (born Layne Rutherford Staley, August 22, 1967 â€“ April 5, 2002) was an American musician best known as the original lead singer and co-songwriter of the rock band Alice in Chains. The band rose to international fame in the early 1990s during Seattle's grunge movement, and became known for Staley's distinct vocal style and tenor voice, as well as the harmonized vocals between him and guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell. Staley was also a member of the glam metal bands Sleze and Alice N' Chains, as well as the supergroups Mad Season and Class of '99.</p>

        <p>From mid-1996 onwards, Staley was out of the public spotlight, never to perform live again. Staley struggled for much of his adult life with depression and drug addiction, which resulted in his death from a speedball overdose at the age of 34 on April 5, 2002.</p>
