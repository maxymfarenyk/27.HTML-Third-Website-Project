    <p id="one">Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a party in Seattle while working at Music Bank rehearsal studios in 1987.[23][24] A few months before that, Cantrell had watched Staley performing with his then-band, Alice N' Chains, in his hometown at the Tacoma Little Theatre, and was impressed by his voice.[25] Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family's house,[12] so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the Music Bank.[18] The two fast friends lived as roommates for over a year in the dilapidated rehearsal space they shared.[18][26]

        Alice N' Chains soon disbanded and Staley joined a funk band,[27] which at the time also required a guitarist.[27] He asked Cantrell to join as a sideman.[27][28] Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band,[28] which at the time did not have a name and included drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr.[27] They started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint, which made him angry.[26][28] The final straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper in front of him – he decided to join the band after that.[26] Cantrell said this about Staley's voice: "I knew that voice was the guy I wanted to be playing with. It sounded like it came out of a 350-pound biker rather than skinny little Layne. I considered his voice to be my voice."[18] Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987, Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis.[26] The band had names like "Fuck"[27][26] and "Diamond Lie",[26][29] the latter being the name of Cantrell's previous band.[26]
        
        Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying to fill out a 40-minute set with a couple of original songs along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.[30] Diamond Lie gained attention in the Seattle area and eventually took the name of Staley's previous band, Alice N' Chains, then renamed Alice in Chains.[26][20][31] Staley got permission from his former bandmates to use the name.[32]
        
        Local promoter Randy Hauser became aware of Alice in Chains at a concert and offered to pay for demo recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid in the history of the state.[20] The final demo, completed in 1988, was named The Treehouse Tapes and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records' A&R representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner.[33] Based on The Treehouse Tapes, Terzo signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989.[34][20] The band also recorded another untitled demo over a three-month period in 1989. This recording can be found on the bootleg release Sweet Alice.[35]</p>

        <p id="two">Alice in Chains released their debut album Facelift on August 21, 1990, shaping the band's signature style. The second single, "Man in the Box", with lyrics written by Staley, became a huge hit. "Man in the Box" is widely recognized for its distinctive "wordless opening melody, where Staley's peculiar, tensed-throat vocals are matched in unison with an effects-laden guitar" followed by "portentous lines like: 'Jesus Christ/Deny your maker' and 'He who tries/Will be wasted' with Cantrell's drier, and less-urgent voice."[36]

        Facelift has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA for sales of two million copies in the United States.[37] The band toured in support of the album for two years before releasing the acoustic EP Sap in early 1992.[38] Alice in Chains made a cameo in Cameron Crowe's 1992 film Singles, performing the songs "It Ain't Like That" and "Would?".[39]
        
        In September 1992, Alice in Chains released Dirt.[38] The critically acclaimed album, also the band's most successful, debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, and was certified quadruple platinum.[40][41] Staley designed the sun logo on the album's inlay.[42] During the Dirt tour in Brazil in 1993, Staley saved Starr's life after he had overdosed.[43][44]
        
        Cantrell wrote almost all of the music and lyrics for Alice in Chains, but as time went on, Staley contributed more lyrics. Eventually, Staley would receive credit for about half the lyrics from the entire Alice in Chains catalog prior to the release of Black Gives Way to Blue in 2009.[45] He also wrote the music and the lyrics to "Hate to Feel", "Angry Chair" and "Head Creeps", and melodies to other songs. Staley's lyrics are largely viewed as having dealt with his personal troubles, such as drug use and depression.[18] Staley also played guitar on "Angry Chair"[46][47] and "Hate to Feel".[48] Cantrell said of "Angry Chair" on the liner notes of the 1999 Music Bank box set:
        
        Such a brilliant song. I'm very proud of Layne for writing it. When I've stepped up vocally in the past he's been so supportive, and here was a fine example of him stepping up with the guitar and writing a masterpiece.[49]
        
        In 1994, Alice in Chains released their second EP, Jar of Flies. It debuted at number one, making it the first Alice in Chains release—and the first-ever EP—to do so.[41] The other members of Alice in Chains, seeing Staley's deteriorating condition, opted not to tour in support of Jar of Flies.[18] Following the album's release, Staley entered a rehabilitation clinic and began to work on a side project with several Seattle musicians, Mike McCready of Pearl Jam, Barrett Martin of Screaming Trees and John Baker Saunders of The Walkabouts.[50] The band worked on material for several months and played their first show at the Crocodile Cafe in Seattle under the name "The Gacy Bunch" on October 12, 1994.[51][52] Within a few weeks, the band changed its name to Mad Season.[53] In January 1995, Mad Season performed two songs on Pearl Jam's Self-Pollution satellite radio broadcast, "Lifeless Dead" and "I Don't Know Anything".[54] The band completed an album, titled Above, which was released in March 1995. The first single, "River of Deceit", became a modest success on alternative radio. A live performance filmed at the Moore Theatre in Seattle was released in August 1995 as a home video, Live at the Moore.[55]
        
        During Alice in Chains' hiatus, reports of Staley's addiction began to gain widespread circulation in fan and media communities, in part due to changes in his physical condition brought on by prolonged heroin abuse.[56]</p>    <a href="#top">top</a>  
    <p id="three">Alice in Chains regrouped to record Alice in Chains, sometimes referred to as "Tripod", which was released in November 1995. The album debuted at the top of the U.S. charts,[57] and has since been awarded—along with Facelift and Jar of Flies—double platinum status.[40] With the exceptions of "Grind", "Heaven Beside You", and "Over Now", the lyrics were all written by Staley,[58] making this album his greatest lyrical contribution to the band's catalogue. To accompany the album, the band released a home video, The Nona Tapes,[59] but the band lapsed again, failing to complete tours planned in support of the album. When asked about the frustration of not touring to support the record, Cantrell provided some insight into how Staley's addictions led to tensions within the band: "Very frustrating, but we stuck it out. We rode the good times together, and we stuck together through the hard times. We never stabbed each other in the back and spilled our guts and [did] that kind of bullshit that you see happen a lot."[60] "Drugs worked for me for years," Staley told Rolling Stone in February 1996, "and now they're turning against me, now I'm walking through hell and this sucks. I didn't want my fans to think that heroin was cool. But then I've had fans come up to me and give me the thumbs up, telling me they're high. That's exactly what I didn't want to happen."[12]

        One of Staley's last shows with Alice in Chains was the MTV Unplugged performance in New York on April 10, 1996.[61] The recording of Unplugged came after a long period of inactivity for the band; it was their first concert in two-and-a-half years.[62] Staley made his last performance on July 3, 1996, in Kansas City, Missouri, while Alice in Chains were touring with Kiss.[18]</p>
